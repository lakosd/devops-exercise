Findings regarding the relationship of Docker containers and their host

- Containers share the kernel with the host. Because of this, properties like
  uptime and disk space are also shared.
- Docker creates its own network for the containers, so networking is
  separated. However, we can still gain access to the network by exposing ports
  on containers.
- Docker also separates the processes running within the containers.
