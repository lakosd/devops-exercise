I used phind.com to help me generate the code for main.rs in service2. My
motivation was to learn more about Rust. Writing the code myself would have
been significantly time consuming, since I'm in the earliest stages of learning
the language.

The tool gave a good starting point to implement service2, but it never
provided actual working code. I had to modify my code quite a bit.

An example for a mistake the LLM made was treating piped commands (e.g.
`... | awk ...`) as arguments to the first command, while
`std::process::Command` has its own way of dealing with pipes.
